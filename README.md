Histograms, Filters, Deconvolution, Blending

The goal in this assignment is to get you acquainted with filtering in the spatial domain as well as in the frequency domain.
Laplacian Blending using Image Pyramids is a very good intro to working and thinking in frequencies, and Deconvolution is a neat trick.

The code given performs the following functionalities:

1. Perform Histogram Equalization on the given input image.
2.Perform Low-Pass, High-Pass and Deconvolution on the given input image.
3.Perform Laplacian Blending on the two input images (blend them together).
