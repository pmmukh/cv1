Histograms, Filters, Deconvolution, Blending

The goal in this assignment is to get you acquainted with filtering in the spatial domain as well as in the frequency domain.
Laplacian Blending using Image Pyramids is a very good intro to working and thinking in frequencies, and Deconvolution is a neat trick.

The code given performs the following functionalities:

1. Perform Histogram Equalization on the given input image.
2.Perform Low-Pass, High-Pass and Deconvolution on the given input image.
3.Perform Laplacian Blending on the two input images (blend them together).

To run the code, pass the question number (1 for hist equalization, 2 for lpf/hpf/convolution, 3 for laplacian blending) and then the images as required (1 for hist eq. , 2 for others) as function arguments
